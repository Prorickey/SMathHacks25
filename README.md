## Overview

ARES is an integrated hardware-software solution featuring a remote sensor suite to detect temperature, humidity, seismic activity, and soil moisture monitoring on Mars. The nature of ARES' scalable mesh network deployment enables real-time environmental data acquisition across a distributed sensor array on multiple varied geographic locations simultaneously. A geospatially interactive interface allows users to access and analyze live telemetry along with a visualization of recently recorded data.

## Inspiration

The idea for ARES emerged from the need for a more efficient and scalable approach to environmental monitoring on Mars. Existing planetary weather stations such as NASA's InSight lander and Curiosity's REMS provide valuable atmospheric and seismic data but are limited in coverage and flexibility. InSight, for example, offers stationary readings from a single location, while Curiosity's sensors can only gather data wherever the rover happens to be.

</p>

These limitations pose challenges for understanding global weather patterns, seismic activity, and potential water presence on Mars. Given the planet's extreme conditions‚Äîdust storms, drastic temperature shifts, and geological activity‚Äîthere is a critical need for a distributed, autonomous sensor system capable of continuous real-time data collection across multiple locations.

ARES was designed to address these challenges through a scalable mesh network of remote sensor pods that can be deployed across varied Martian terrain. These pods continuously monitor temperature, humidity, seismic activity, and soil moisture, providing high-resolution environmental data to researchers.

## Hardware Design

### CAD Model

We created a hexagonal case for our electronics, with spots on the top for the sunlight and temperature/humidity sensor, as those needed access to light or the air respectively. We created an opening on the bottom of the hexagonal case for the soil moisture sensor to be deployed from.

</p>

Spikes were added on the bottom as a way for the device to mount into extraterrestrial soil when dropped from a decent height, and serves to secure the device in place during dangerous Martian conditions such as storms and earthquakes.

### Internal Architecture

</p>

Internally, we designed mounts for:
- **Temperature/Humidity Sensor** (left side) - Protected by mesh for air access
- **Sunlight Sensor** (right side) - Faces upward with clear protective tape
- **MPU6050 Accelerometer/Gyroscope** - Mounted directly for seismic detection
- **Servo Motor** - For soil moisture probe deployment

### Electrical Engineering

</p>

We developed the circuit using an ESP32 architecture for its native Wi-Fi capabilities, allowing wireless data transmission. The system was initially prototyped on a breadboard before final integration.
